## PR Checklists

<!-- Feel free to delete any checklists that do not apply to this PR -->

For new code:

- [ ] Has Pytest style unit tests (and `pytest lib/matplotlib/tests` passes)

- [ ] New code is documented, with examples if plot related

For new documentation:

- [ ] Documentation is sphinx and numpydoc compliant (the docs should [build](https://matplotlib.org/devel/documenting_mpl.html#building-the-docs) without error)

<!--
A few other common gotchas:

- Do not create the PR out of master, but out of a separate branch.

- The PR title should summarize the changes, for example "Raise ValueError on
  non-numeric input to set_xlim". Avoid non-descriptive titles such as
  "Addresses issue #8576".

- If you are contributing fixes to docstrings, please pay attention to
  http://matplotlib.org/devel/documenting_mpl.html#formatting. In particular,
  note the difference between using single backquotes, double backquotes, and
  asterisks in the markup.

We understand that PRs can sometimes be overwhelming, especially as the
reviews start coming in. Please let us know if the reviews are unclear or
the recommended next step seems overly demanding, if you would like help in
addressing a reviewer's comments, or if you have been waiting too long to hear
back on your PR.
